**Title:**

Driving Luxury Trends: Exploring BMW Global Sales Performance

**Motivations:**

BMW is one of the world’s most well-known luxury car brands. However, we
have noticed that the way people use BMW cars seems quite different in
the United States compared to China. This made us interested in
exploring the differences in BMW consumption across the world. In this
project, we will focus on sales trends, regional variations, and the
impact of external factors such as economic changes or new model
launches. By analyzing BMW’s sales data over time and across regions, we
hope to understand how market conditions, consumer preferences, and
global events influence the company’s performance. Studying these
patterns can also help us better evaluate BMW’s business strategy and
provide a broader view of how luxury brands are adapting to the market
shift from traditional fuel vehicles to electric mobility.

**Intended final products:**

Exploratory Sales Analysis:

We will begin by conducting a global exploratory analysis of BMW sales
across all regions included in the dataset. This will involve
summarizing overall sales volume, identifying the most popular BMW
models, and examining price and model distribution patterns across
different countries. We will create visualizations such as time-series
trend lines and bar charts, as well as a world map with color gradients
to show variation in BMW sales intensity across regions. This global
perspective will allow us to observe broad market patterns and highlight
meaningful differences in consumer behavior internationally, providing a
foundation for any deeper regional comparisons, such as between China
and the United States.

Comparative Market Evaluation:

We will analyze how broader economic conditions, new model releases, and
shifts in fuel technology (gasoline vs. hybrid vs. electric) may
influence BMW sales performance. This includes comparing sales growth
rates, identifying peak and decline periods, and assessing differences
in adoption of electric models across regions. We will also highlight
brand strategy implications, particularly how BMW adapts to changing
consumer demands in China versus the U.S.

Interactive Visualization Dashboard and Final Report:

We will develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore
BMW sales data by region, year, model type, and fuel type. This
dashboard will be featured on our project website alongside a clearly
written final report that explains our motivation, data processing
steps, methods, findings, and interpretation. The GitHub repository will
include all code for full reproducibility.

Project Website and Screencast Presentation:

We will create a public-facing website that summarizes our key insights
and displays our interactive visualizations in a user-friendly format.
Additionally, we will produce a two-minute narrated screencast
introducing the motivation behind examining BMW’s global sales
variation, demonstrating major visual findings, and summarizing
conclusions regarding how consumer markets differ and how BMW is
positioned in the shifting luxury auto industry.

Handle missing or inconsistent variables.

Filter and group data.

Create derived variables such as total yearly sales, sales growth rate.

2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Sales Trends Over Time

Regional Comparison

Model-Level Insights

**Planned timeline:**

Week 1 (from now on):

Set up githhub repo; divide roles; download and check BMW dataset;
Prepare for the review meeting.

Week 2:

Attend the proposal review meeting;

Clean and organize the data;  
Start basic exploration and simple plots of sales by year and region;

document all steps clearly in rmd

Make basic exploratory plots (sales by year, region, and model)

Week 3

Conduct deeper analyses (growth rate, correlations, regional
comparisons)

Start drafting report sections: Data, Methods, and Exploratory Analysis.

Week 4:

Focus on additional analysis and visual storytelling.  
Add interpretations, discussions, and refine plots.  
Start building the project website (HTML or Quarto/GitHub Pages).

Week 5:

Finalize written report and polish all figures.  
Record and edit the 2-minute screencast; upload to YouTube

Integrate the screencast and report into the website.  
Submit all deliverables by Dec 6, 11:59 pm.

Week 6:
